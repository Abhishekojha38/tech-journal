# 🧠 Tech Journal

This repository serves as a personal **technical knowledge journal**, where I
document various topics, explorations, and learnings related to system software,
Linux, and embedded development.

Each topic is organized in its own folder with detailed notes, commands, and
reference materials.

## 📁 Topics

- **[KGDB](./kgdb/kgdb.md)** — Kernel debugging setup and usage details,
including configuration, commands, and workflow examples.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This journal is continuously evolving as I explore new areas.  
Expect ongoing additions, refinements, and deeper insights over time.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily a personal technical journal, but discussions and suggestions
are welcome via issues or pull requests.
