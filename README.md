# 🧠 Tech Journal

This repository serves as a personal **technical knowledge journal**, where I
document various topics, explorations, and learnings related to system software,
Linux, and embedded development.

Each topic is organized in its own folder with detailed notes, commands, and
reference materials.

## 📁 Topics

including configuration, commands, and workflow examples.

- **[Ext4-journal](./ext4-journal/ext4_journal_recovery_bug.adoc)** — Deep dive into EXT4 journal corruption analysis,
  checksum mismatches, and debugging using `GDB`.  
  Includes reproduction steps, kernel insights, and references to upstream patches
  (e.g., commit fix for kernel `6.1.22`).

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This journal is continuously evolving as I explore new areas.  
Expect ongoing additions, refinements, and deeper insights over time.
